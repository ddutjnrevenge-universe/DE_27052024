# 1. Data Extraction Methods: Online vs. Offline
Data can be extracted either **online from the source system** or **offline from an already existing structure**. The chosen method depends on the logical extraction capabilities and restrictions of the source system.
## Comparison
### Similarities
- **Data Sources:** Both methods can extract data from similar sources, such as databases, APIs, files, and web scraping.
- **Techniques:** Techniques like ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), data cleaning, and data transformation can be applied in both scenarios.
- **Goals:** The primary goal of both methods is to gather, process, and prepare data for analysis and use in applications or decision-making.

### Differences

| **Aspect**              | **Online Extraction**                                                                                     | **Offline Extraction**                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Source**         | Directly from the data source to the destination repository (Data Warehouse or Data Lake).               | Staged explicitly outside the original source system.                                                                  |
| **Connection**          | Requires direct connection to the source tables or intermediate systems (e.g., snapshot logs, change tables). | Typically applied to structured data sources or converted to structured format during acquisition.                    |
| **Structure**           | Exact replica of the original system, except for higher levels of structuring.                           | Data has an existing structure (e.g., flat files, redo logs, archive logs, dump files, transportable tablespaces).    |
| **Timing**              | Continuous or near-continuous, often requiring minimal latency.                                          | Periodic, scheduled at specific intervals (e.g., nightly, weekly).                                                     |
| **Infrastructure**      | Requires robust, high-availability infrastructure.                                                       | Can use less complex infrastructure, processing done during off-peak hours.                                            |
| **Data Freshness**      | Provides the most up-to-date data, crucial for time-sensitive applications.                              | Data may be stale, reflecting the state of the system at the last extraction point.                                     |
| **Complexity and Cost** | Typically more complex and costly due to real-time data pipelines and fault tolerance.                   | Generally simpler and more cost-effective, fewer immediate performance demands.                                        |

### ! NOTE
- **Flat files**: in a defined, generic format. Additional information about the source object is necessary for further processing.
- **Dump files**: Oracle-specific format, info about source object is included
- **Redo, Archive logs**: info is in special, additional dumpfile
- **Transportable tablespaces**: powerful way to extract and move large volumes of data between Oracle databases

# 2. ETL vs ELT

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) are two common approaches for data integration and processing. ETL and ELT are both methods used to integrate and process data from various sources. However, they differ in the sequence of operations and the timing of data transformation.


## Comparison

### Similarities
- **Data Sources:** Both ETL and ELT can extract data from a variety of sources, including databases, APIs, files, and web scraping.
- **Data Processing:** Both methods involve some form of data processing, including transformation and loading into a target destination.
- **Data Integration:** Both ETL and ELT are used for data integration purposes, combining data from multiple sources into a unified format.

### Differences

| **Aspect**          | **ETL**                                                                                                 | **ELT**                                                                                            |

| **Scalability**     | May face scalability challenges due to processing and storage requirements.                            | Can potentially offer better scalability as processing is distributed across the target system.   |
| **Performance**     | Performance may vary based on the volume of data and complexity of transformations.                      | Performance may be optimized for large-scale data processing due to parallel processing capabilities.|

## Advantages and Disadvantages

|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Level of Isolation**| Isolates Python environments, allowing different versions of libraries and packages to coexist on the same system. | Provides complete OS-level virtualization, allowing for the deployment of multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. | Provides lightweight application-level virtualization, isolating applications and their dependencies while sharing the host OS kernel. |
| **Resource Overhead** | Minimal resource overhead, as it shares the host system's kernel and only isolates Python environments. | High resource overhead, as it requires a full guest OS for each virtual machine.                           | Minimal resource overhead compared to virtual machines, as it shares the host OS kernel and uses container images for application dependencies. |
| **Boot Time**         | Quick boot time, as it does not need to start a separate OS.                                            | Longer boot time, as it needs to start a separate guest OS.                                               | Quick boot time, as it does not need to boot a separate OS, and container images are lightweight. |
| **Operating System**  | Shares the host OS kernel and runs Python applications.                                                  | Runs a complete guest OS, which can be different from the host OS.                                         | Shares the host OS kernel and runs applications in isolated user space.                            |
| **Use Cases**         | Ideal for Python development, managing dependencies, and avoiding conflicts between different versions of libraries. | Suitable for running multiple operating systems on the same hardware, testing software compatibility, and creating development environments. | Well-suited for microservices architecture, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and cloud-native applications. |
